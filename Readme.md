- Create a new Node.js project
- Install the necessary packages, such as `ftp` for FTP file operations and the Shopify API client library (e.g., `shopify-api-node`)

1. **Connect to the FTP server and retrieve file list**:
   - Use the `ftp` package to connect to the FTP server
   - Retrieve the list of PDF files available on the FTP server
2. **Implement the file transfer logic**:
   - Iterate through the list of PDF files
   - For each file:
     - Check if the file has already been transferred to Shopify
     - If not, download the file from the FTP server
     - Upload the file to the Shopify store's file section using the Shopify API client
     - Keep track of the transferred files to avoid duplicates
3. **Handle partial failures and resume transfers**:
   - Implement a checkpoint system to keep track of the files that have been successfully transferred
   - If the script is interrupted (e.g., server goes down), resume the transfer process from the last successful checkpoint
4. **Error handling and logging**:
   - Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle any issues that may arise during the file transfer process
   - Log the progress, errors, and any other relevant information for debugging and monitoring purposes
5. **Automate the script execution**:
   - Set up a scheduled task or a cron job to run the script periodically (e.g., daily, weekly) to keep the Shopify store's file section up-to-date
6. **Test and refine the script**:
   - Thoroughly test the script with various edge cases, such as network failures, server downtime, and large file transfers
   - Optimize the script's performance and reliability based on the testing results
